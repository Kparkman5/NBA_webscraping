# NBA_webscraping
Practicing Webscraping using Python package beautifulsoup to collect data from NBA.com on stat leaders from the past 24 hours of games. Based on the statistical category entered by the user (points, rebounds, assists, etc.), it will display the top 5 players and their stats for that category.
